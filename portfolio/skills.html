    <p class="text-2">I possess strong skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Mathematics.  
With a passion for crafting clean and responsive web interfaces, I specialize in front-end development using modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create engaging and interactive user experiences. My understanding of design principles, combined with technical proficiency, helps me build websites that are not only functional but visually appealing.

In addition to web development, my solid foundation in Mathematics enhances my problem-solving abilities and logical thinking, which I apply to coding challenges and development tasks alike.

I'm continuously exploring new tools and technologies to improve my skill set and stay current in the evolving world of web development.
